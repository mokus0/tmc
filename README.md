USB Test and Measurement Class support for Rust
================================================

This library allows Rust applications to control USB TMC devices (typically used for lab instrumentation).  It's still very new, incomplete, and unpolished, but I think what is there does follow the spec.  It seems to work well on the few devices I have here, at least.
